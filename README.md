# Subway AU Macro Calculator (in HTML5 and JS)

## Description

Subway AU Macro Calculator is a JavaScript-based tool that allows users to calculate the nutritional values of their Subway sandwich based on selected ingredients. This project utilizes HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to provide an interactive user experience. Users can select bread type, meat, cheese, salads, sauces, and extras to compute the total macronutrients (calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates) of their custom Subway sandwich.

Purely so if anyone wanted to try it out, they can do so here: https://kkdn7355.github.io/Calculator-Subway-Sandwich-Macros/
